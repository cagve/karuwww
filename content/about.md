title: "About me"

Phd Candiate at , Toulouse, France. </p>
I am currently a PhD student at [IRIT]("https://www.irit.fr/") in Toulouse, France. Before beginning my doctoral studies, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of MÃ¡laga and Interuniversity Master degree in Logic and Philosophy of Science.

My research interests lie primarily in modal logic, with a particular focus on belief revision, causality, and counterfactual reasoning. I aim to explore how formal frameworks can better capture the dynamics of rational belief change and causal inference.
